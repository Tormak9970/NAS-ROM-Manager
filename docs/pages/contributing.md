# Contributing

Contributing to projects can be daunting, so here's a quick guide on what you can do to help out.


## Report Bugs / Issues

If you run into any problems / weird behavior while using NRM, please open a Bug Report on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tormak9970/NAS-ROM-Manager/issues). This lets me know about problems I may have overlooked.


## Feature Requests

Got an idea for something to add to NRM? Let me know! You can open an issue on GitHub [here]([GitHub](https://github.com/Tormak9970/NAS-ROM-Manager/issues)), and follow the template to make it as easy as possible to implement.


## PRs / Other Contributions

If you want to contribute directly, PRs are welcome. Please try to prioritize open issues / feature requests, and adhere to a high standard of code quality.
